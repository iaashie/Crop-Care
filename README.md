# Crop Care - Smart Soil Testing System

An IoT and AI-powered solution for real-time soil analysis, providing smart crop and fertilizer recommendations to promote sustainable and precision agriculture.

## Problem Statement

Traditional farming lacks real-time insights into soil health, leading to inefficiencies in resource usage. Farmers need an affordable, accessible system that provides accurate, data-driven recommendations to improve crop yield and soil sustainability.

## Our Solution

Crop Care is a real-time IoT-based soil testing system that leverages sensors and AI/ML models to provide actionable recommendations for crop and fertilizer usage.

### Key Features

- Real-time measurement of soil moisture, pH, temperature, and nutrients (NPK).
- Machine Learning-based soil type identification using camera images.
- Crop and fertilizer recommendation engine trained on 800+ datasets.
- Web dashboard for farmers to visualize results instantly.
- Affordable and scalable for small and marginal farmers.

## Tech Stack
